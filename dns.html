            <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>
                Domain Name System is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for 
                Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of domain names( it is 
                a website's address on the Internet ) along with the resources, such as 
                IP addresses, that are associated with them. The most prominent function 
                of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) 
                to a numeric IP address (such as 192.0.2.172). This process of mapping a 
                domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a DNS lookup. By contrast, a 
                reverse DNS lookup (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an 
                IP address.

                Consisting of five distinct components. At the highest level is the root domain, 
                which is the apex of the domain name hierarchy. Underneath the root domain are 
                the top-level domains, further divided into second-level domains, third-level 
                domains, and so on.

                DNS records, also called zone files, are instructions in authoritative DNS servers. 
                They link domains to IP addresses and define how requests for that domain should 
                be handled. These records use DNS syntax, which is a set of commands. Each record has 
                a TTL (time-to-live) for refreshing by DNS servers.

                The web hierarchy plays a critical role in optimizing the efficiency and 
                reliability of internet communication. It structured design, redundancy, scalability, 
                and distribution of resources are essential elements that help maintain a seamless 
                and dependable online experience for users worldwide.

                <strong>DDos Attacks</strong>, this requires that you have the best security features put in place. 
                At times, DNS problems are as a result of malicious attacks by hackers. They do 
                this by driving high traffic to your site until it eventually crashes. Hence the need 
                of investing in alternate security features. Solution is to Employ the use of a high 
                performance DDOS mitigation device.
                <br>
                <strong>High DNS Latency</strong>, High DNS latency equals high loading times. High DNS latency can be 
                as a result of the DNS name servers not being in close geographic proximity to a large 
                percentage of users who visit your site. Another reason might be network congestion.
                Most of the solution is to change servers where is closest to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, understanding DNS is essential for practicing responsible internet usage and 
                digital citizenship. It promotes online privacy, security, content verification, ethical 
                content creation, intellectual property respect, inclusivity, online etiquette, 
                and critical thinking all crucial aspects of responsible and ethical behavior on the digital age.
