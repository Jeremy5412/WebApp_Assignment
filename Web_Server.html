                        On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that 
                        stores web server software and a website's component 
                        files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, 
                        and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the 
                        Internet and supports physical data interchange with 
                        other devices connected to the web.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        On the software side, a web server includes several 
                        parts that control how web users access hosted files. 
                        At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server 
                        is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and 
                        HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). 
                        An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain 
                        names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the 
                        content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

            </div>

                As the server as a hardware is a computer, then what those the hardware 
                component do inside the server?

                        <strong>Motherboard</strong>: It connects all parts of a server. A motherboard's 
                        size dictates the amount of storage and the number of hard drives 
                        that can connect to a server.

                    <li>
                        <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>: It interprets and executes instructions, 
                        processing data and performing tasks like serving web pages, 
                        running database queries, and executing other program and computing 
                        commands.

                        drive or solid state drive, stores this data and instructions, 
                        and enables the central processing unit (CPU) to access it.

                        It uses a controller card for optimum processing functions. 
                        A server housing large amounts of data may need multiple hard drives.

                As server need to run, they need softwares. Here are some software that are recommanded by 
                elegant themes

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Apatch</strong>: It is the second most popular web server 
                    software, used by 31.5 percent of all known websites. Itâ€™s an 
                    open-source project that uses HTTP protocol and operates across 
                    various OSs, including Windows and Linux.
                    <br>
                    Apache is highly customizable, thanks to its modular structure, 
                    making it versatile for various tasks. It support multiple programming 
                    languages and benefits from an active developer community. 
                    Its compatibility with PHP also makes it a top choice for 
                    hosting WordPress websites.

                <li>
                    <strong>NGINX</strong>: For a top-notch web server, think about using NGINX, 
                    which has become more popular than Apache, serving over 33 percent of 
                    known websites. NGINX works well on both Linux and Windows and is famous 
                    for its high-performance capabilities, perfect for busy website. It handles 
                    many connection at once, leading to faster load times and less strain on 
                    your server.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>LiteSpeed</strong>: LiteSpeed is a lightweight and security-focused web 
                    server known for its excellent performance and scalability without overloading 
                    your server. It come with built-in protection against DDoS attacks and can manage 
                    sudden traffic surges effectively. Notably, it serves PHP faster than many other 
                    servers, making it an excellent choice for high-traffic or resource-intensive 
                    website.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>When we need to check the server's traffic or condition, we use load balancer</strong></p>
            <p>
                Load balancing can be done using hardware or software solutions. Hardware load balancers 
                are physical devices installed on-site, while software load balancers are applications 
                installed on private servers or delivered as a managed cloud service.
                <br>
                Load balancers manage incoming client requests in real-time and direct them to the best-suited backend 
                servers to prevent overloading. This helps distribute the workload efficiently.
                When a server is chosen, the load balancer facilitate communication between the client and server 
                by matching their IP addresses. This allows them to work together until the session ends.
                In times of high network traffic, load balancers can add more servers to handle the load. 
                <br>
                Conversely, during low activity, they can reduce the number of available servers. Load 
                balancers can also improve performance by routing traffic to cache servers where previous 
                requests are temporarily stored.

                Understanding web server hardware and software align with responsible technology 
                use by enabling individuals and organizations to create, manage, and maintain 
                digital services that are efficient, secure, accessible, and respectful of user 
                privacy and ethical principles. This understanding empower technology users to 
                make informed decisions that benefit society and the environment.
